        name: Rocky Valley
        description: Without the name giving too much away, this valley a little east of Tintagel is a rather beautiful spectacle. As the river cuts its way to the sea, a tall, craggy gorge is cut, with hidden waterfalls and intrepid trails to unpick. Don’t miss the early Bronze Age labyrinth carvings that add a touch of mystery to an already beguiling landscape.
      - id: tip2
        name: Roseland Peninsula
        description: Enter this garden of hedgerows and pastures, where typical Cornish beauty rolls across gentle hills and off craggy cliffs. Unpick quiet coves and unspoilt beaches, before heading to Roseland’s heart, the town of St Mawes. This remarkably cosmopolitan spot has become somewhat of a ‘destination’, with a smart set of fine restaurants, boutiques and cafes, all graced by the effortlessly picturesque surroundings.

        name: Treasure hunting in Walcot Village, Bath
        description: Known as the Artisan Quarter, this charming Bath neighbourhood is filled with eclectic shops. Discover your next treasure in a clutch of antique shops, or find something local and handmade in one of the many independent boutiques. Don’t miss the grotesque faces dotted on the wall of The Paragon, some representing characters from local myths, some carvings of real life locals.
      - id: tip2
        name: City night kayaking down the Avon, Bath
        description: A rather peculiar way of exploring Bath, breeze past the gorgeous Georgian architecture from the slow ebb and flow of the river Avon, as you stand atop your paddleboard for a nighttime - well, we guess - paddle. Original Wild offers a range of waterborne experiences, but seeing the frankly beautiful city of Bath lit up at night, whilst also surfing along the river, is an experience not quickly forgotten.

        description: Who’s never once dreamed of fishing in a glassy stream, surrounded by the ancient trees of a magical woodland? The chalk streams of the rivers Test, Itchen and Wiltshire Avon in the New Forest are the birthplace of fly fishing, home to brown trout, grayling and atlantic salmon alike - and with plenty of fishing guides available in the local area to show you the ropes, you’ll be hooking your first catch in no time. Immersed in the spectral beauty of this incredible forest - with a packed lunch and flask of coffee in tow - lose yourself to the reflective wonders of the sport.

        name: Sustainable Foraging in Studland Bay, Dorset
        description: Get closer to nature and learn how to live off the land as you gather cooking ingredients from the sea and shoreline of Studland Bay in Dorset. The Fore Adventure sea school has day-long crash courses in the art of foraging, teaching you how to find everything from crabs and cockles to edible plants and seaweeds. You travel by kayak to the creeks and islands around the bay, before bringing all your freshly-foraged ingredients together in the evening for a feast on the beach.

        name: Explore Waterfall Country in Wales
        description: There are some truly spectacular waterfalls in the Vale of Neath. The Hollywood starlet is Henrhyd Falls, as featured in the film Batman – yet the heart of this fascinating spot lies further east. Try the Four Falls Walk to see the best of the Vale of Neath. From the dramatic Sgwd Clun-Gwyn that cascades from one tier into the next, to the spellbinding Sgwd yr Eira curtain where you can actually walk behind the falls, Waterfall Country is a truly magical place.

        name: Seafood dining in Oban, Argyll
        description: Known as ‘little bay’ in Gaelic, the seemingly unremarkable fishing town of Oban is the seafood capital of Scotland. After a day of walking through the achingly-beautiful Argyll hillsides, discover an abundance of award-winning restaurants and eateries along the harbour, a collection of locally-sourced gems serving up the freshest of catches, before winding down with a glass of malt whiskey taken straight from the local distillery. With fresh air, fresh food and soul-stirring scenery wherever you look, the town is a gateway to rejuvenation.

Your arrival proves as stirring as the tipples that await, with a network of ferry crossings darting around the beguiling isles off the mainland. Exploring Islay will typically revolve around discovering some of the greatest, peatiest whiskies in the world - one dram at a time.

        name: Hop between the Quarters of Belfast
        description: The Titanic City is a lively hub that effortlessly mixes Victorian pomp, industrial edge and contemporary cool. A city of characters, its quarters each take on different personalities; the red-brick and cobbles of the Cathedral Quarter, the post-industrial, cultural revival of the Titanic Quarter, and the buzzing drinks and dining scene of the trendy Linen Quarter – to name a few. Each shows a side to the city that remains totally enthralling, all easily walkable, and combined making Belfast wonderfully good craic.
